## DETAILS // 

Located in the heart of Seattle, along the Duwamish Greenbelt, the Heron‚Äôs Nest is a place to find solace in ever growing surroundings. Perched on the hills along the Duwamish River, and located in the largest contiguous forest left in the city, we are a place to stay, learn, grow, and build together. 

The Heron‚Äôs Nest Outdoor Education Center (awaiting 501c3 Non-Profit status) began as a community building project amidst a global pandemic in June 2020.  A group of dedicated West Seattle community members joined together to create an outdoor education facility to allow all members and visitors of the community to have a space to share together while working outdoors in a safe capacity.  The goal of this project is to provide a safe place for youth and adults to learn skills, trades and outdoor stewardship.  

This project is the first ever repatriation attempt with respect to the Duwamish Tribe and would have significant impacts on the Tribe‚Äôs recognition claims. Now that the property has been cleaned up and new facilities have been created, there is ample space for meaningful community programming, education, social events, traditional practices, gardening/farming, and more.
